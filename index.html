        <p>My favorite hobby is doing math. At home, I do math, and I sometimes have math homework.
            I am 10 years old and doing algebra and division. Sometimes math frustrates me(a lot), but I still enjoy it. It is a good source of knowledge, and has lots of applications in the real world, and it makes you sucsseful.
